This is the midway milestone hi-fidelity prototype. In this prototype, users are able to complete the task of sharing new music. They are able to browse and listen to recommendations from friends, while also sharing the music they are listening to with the people we recommend. Not all features are currently implemented at this stage, but they will be soon. This prototype is confirmed to be working in Firefox and Google Chrome browsers.
===================================================================================================================================================
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS:
* Merge requires at minimum Android 4.4 to run
* Require 150MB of space for the device application version.

TO NOTE:
If you have an Android device that meets the above minimum requirements, we highly recommend that you download and test the app on your device. This provides with the complete experience that Merge is trying to create. Skip to the section titled "Ideal Launching Methods on an Actual Device"

IDEAL LAUNCHING METHODS ON AN ACTUAL DEVICE

If you have an Android phone or device, you can download the apk directly and install it onto your device for use.
Follow the steps below beginning at step 6 with an open browser. You should download the apk from the following URL:
"https://ccabrales.github.io/merge/assignments/merge.apk.zip"
You may need to enable installation in your device settings. Go to Settings > Security (Or Settings > Applications) and check the box next to "Unknown Sources." A dialogue box may pop up asking you to confirm, and you can just press OK.

TO LAUNCH THE MERGE PROTOTYPE IN A BROWSER FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW:

**At this time, the apk is too large for the emulator. Please load onto a physical device using the steps above!
1. Navigate to https://www.manymo.com
2. Create a login and verify your email address if you do not already have an account
3. Choose "Launch Emulators" from the top menu
4. Choose the 720x1280 (320dpi) emulator in the second row on the left, and click on the arrow next to LAUNCH. Select "Android 4.4 - Google APIs" from the drop down menu.
5. Wait for the emulator to load, and open the emulator's browser
6. Navigate to the url "https://ccabrales.github.io/merge/assignments/merge.apk.zip" and wait for the file to download
7. Once downloaded, click on the completed download and install the Merge apk
8. Select open, and now Merge is running in your emulator!


HOW TO USE THE MERGE PROTOTYPE

The screen you are greeted with is the recommendations screen. Here you can browse some of the music that other people have recommended you listen to. You can swipe left and right on the album art to see what other songs are recommended and by whom. Clicking on one of these songs will start playing it and bring you to the now playing screen (no sound on the computer version).

On the now playing screen you can favorite the song, toggle play/pause, and skip to the next song. The three faces at the bottom of the screen are friends that we think would like the song you are listening to. Tap and drag them into the center of the screen to share the song with them, and somebody else will take their place!

To return to the recommendations page, open the menu and select Recommendations or use the Android device's back button located along the bottom of the device.

You may also view the musical profiles of friends and swipe through their top 10, most recently favorited songs. If you can't find a friend along the bottom of the screen, there is a search function at the top that allows you to easily navigate through Facebook friends and view their profiles.

We hope you enjoy Merge!


IN CASE OF CRASHES OR OTHER BUGS IN EMULATOR

First, don't panic! This is bound to happen while using an emulator such as this one. If Merge crashes, just go back to the apps page on the device and click on the android icon that says "Merge" to start it up again. This may or may not fix the issues you are having.
